# Uploader
This app is a simple uploader in nodejs to upload any type of file to a server where it can then be downloaded from SFTP or whatever.

The primary motivation for this simple project is gathering some videos from friends and family for a collaborative video project, where those working the uploading end may not be very technically-savvy.
